| ***Q***  | Can you give me more details about how the blank penalty works?  |
| ***A***  | Blanks/wildcards are one of the more confusing aspects of the game, but they add a level of unpredictability and creative gameplay that would not otherwise be possible. Every time you use a blank, either by taking it from the pool and designating it or by changing it from an existing word you must take an additional P tiles from the pool where P is "blank penalty". For example, if the blank penalty is 2 and the minimum word length is 7, then in order to use a blank you would need to make at least a 10 letter word. You could do this two ways: either by taking 10 tiles directly from the pool or by taking an existing 7 letter word, adding one tile to it to make the steal, and then adding two more from the pool. Similarly the shortest playable word containing two blanks would have to be 13-letters in length. Moreover to *change* a blank you must take P tiles from the pool, so in the previous example example one could take the existing 10-letter word containing a blank, change the blank to something else, and add 2 tiles from the pool to make a 12-letter word.|

| ***Q***  | What about the robots?  |
| ***A***  | There is a formula that calculates how often on average a robot will attempt to think of a word based on their skill level and the number of tiles in the pool. Also Genius bot knows all the words while Novice bot knows only common words found in the "Common English Lexicon", a subset of CSW21. (For more informaito non CEL, see [here](https://github.com/Fj00/CEL). Standard bot and and Expert bot will search in the larger wordlist 33% and 67% of the time respectively.  |

| ***Q***  | Is there any way to record my games for posterity? |
| ***A***  | That's another feature that's coming soon. For now if there's a specific game you're interested in I can pull it from the logs and send it to you. Later you will be able save a file containing your record and review it. |
