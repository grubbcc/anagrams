Anagrams is a classic word game of thought and thievery. For many players, including myself, their first encounter with Anagrams occurred at the end of a long day of playing tournament Scrabble™, but it has a long popular history as well. Originating in Victorian England (according to the Wikipedia article), the first published version dates to 1877 or earlier. It has appeared in various tabletop versions over the years, one of which even made its way into a Hitchcock movie:

It can be played with any set of letter tiles, but until recently there has not been any way to play over the web. Now there at least three different ways to play: Jay Chan's mobile-friendly Snatch!, Carl Johnson's browser-based Anagrams Blitz, and the program on this page.

## How to Play

Gameplay is simple: A certain number of tiles are placed face down into a pool on the table. As they are turned over one at a time, players attempt to form words out of them. If a player is successful at finding a word, they arrange the tiles to spell out the word and place them in front of themselves. There is no penalty for guessing incorrectly.

Play continues as before, except that now it is possible to steal an existing word. This means adding one or more tiles from the pool to a word to form a longer word. If you steal your opponent's word, it's yours! You may also steal you own words to prevent anyone else from stealing them first.

There is one small catch, however. In order to make a steal, you must rearrange at least two of the tiles. For example it would be possible to steal LAUNCHPAD from CHALUPA, but you could not steal READING to form PREBOARDING because the latter can be spelled by inserting letters into the former without changing their order.

Scoring methods vary, but in general, the player with the most words a the end of the game win. Long words are awarded more points than short ones.

Those are the basics. But wait! There's more. Check out some these other amazing features:

    * Create a personalized account profile and load customizable settings automatically upon startup
    • Chat with other players before or during a game
    • Postgame analysis mode shows you what words you could have made

## A Personal Note

I am an amateur Java programmer, mostly self taught, as well as an avid Scrabble player. I built this project almost entirely from scratch over the course of several years as a way of learning to program and giving back to the word game community. Many, many hours were spent reading the Java Docs and scouring Stack Overflow for answers.

Since I have benefited greatly from the advice and code of others, I have made this an open source project. Check out the code over at my GitHub page, and feel free to use what you like in your own work. (Just no redistributing or selling without my permission, of course.) If you are an experienced prorgammer, any bug reports or feedback on how I can improve things would be greatly appreciated!
