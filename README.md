What is Anagrams?

Anagrams is a word game of thought and thievery. For many players, including myself, their first encounter with Anagrams occurred at the end of a long day of playing tournament Scrabble™, but it has a long popular history as well. Originating in Victorian England (according to the Wikipedia article), the first published version dates to 1877 or earlier. It has been published in various tabletop version over the years, one of which even made its way into a Hitchcock movie:

It can be played with any set of letter tiles, but until recently there has not been any way to play over the web. Now there at least three different ways to play: Jay Chan's mobile-friendly Snatch!, Carl Johnson's browser-based Anagrams Blitz, and the program on this page.

How to Play

Gameplay is simple: A certain number of tiles are placed face down into a pool on the table. As they are turned over one at a time, players attempt to form words out of them. If a player is successful at finding a word, they arrange the tiles to spell out the word and place them in front of themselves. There is no penalty for guessing incorrectly.

Play continues as before, except that now it is possible to steal an existing word. This means adding one or more tiles from the pool to a word to form a longer word. If you steal your opponent's word, it's yours! You may also steal you own words to prevent anyone else from stealing from you.

There is one small catch, however. In order to make a steal, you must rearrange at least two of the tiles. For example it would be possible to steal LAUNCHPAD from CHALUPA, but you could not steal READING to form PREBOARDING because the latter can be made from the former without the need of any rearrangements.

Scoring methods vary, but in general, the player with the most words a the end of the game win. Long words are awarded more points than short ones.

Those are the basics. But wait! There's more. Check out some these other amazing features:

A Personal Note

I am an amateur Java programmer, mostly self taught, as well as an avid Scrabble player. I built this project almost entirely from scratch over the course of several years as a way of learning to program and giving back to the word game community. Many, many hours were spent reading the documentation and scouring Stack Overflow for answers.

Since I have benefited greatly from the advice and code of others, I have made this an open source project. Check out the code over at my GitHub page, and feel free to use what you like in your own work. (Just no redistributing or selling without my permission, of course.) If you are an experienced progammer, any bug reports or feedback on how I can improve things would be greatly appreciated!

Kickstarter

From webspace to signing certificates to licenses, making a computer program and bringing it to the world can be an expensive ordeal, so if you like this game, please considering making a donation on my Kickstarter page (coming soon). In addition to helping an aspiring programmer put their best forward, you can also experience the following benefits:

    • Early access! Be the first person your block to experience the fun of the word game that is overtaking the world.
    • Custom features! Would you like your picture by your name? Custom speeds? Custom tile sets? Play against two robots at once? Highlights on unstealable words? As long as it doesn't give you an unfair advantage over other players, I will try to make it happen for you.*
    • Be a part of a the new Anagrams Revolution that will change the way humans study words forever. Liberate the dictionary from a arbitrary devotion to words 1 to 8 letters long and put the whole dictionary at your disposal!
    • Get the standalone version of the Word Explorer analysis tool, great for analyzing games, including in-person games.
    • You’ve got my ear and my undying appreciation. Do you have suggestions on how to change the program for the better or features that you think should be implemented? Let me know and I'll see that they are prioritized.
